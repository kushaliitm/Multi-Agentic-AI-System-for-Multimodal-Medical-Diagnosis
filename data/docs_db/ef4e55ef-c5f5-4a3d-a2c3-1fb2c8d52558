97%. MobileNetv2 achieved an accuracy of 95.73% and F1-score of 96%, while ResNet50 achieved an accuracy of 91.54% and F1-score of 91%.

Wang et al. 22 developed an open-source CNN called COVID-Net to detect COVID-19 cases using chest X-ray images. The proposed net can predict the case as one of three classes which are COVID-19 viral infection, non-COVID-19 infection, and normal. Also, an open access benchmark dataset COVIDx was introduced, it contains 13,975 X-ray images collected from 13,870 patients. The COVIDx dataset was generated using five different publicaly available datasets. The accuracy of COVID-Net reached 93.3%.

Panwar et al. 23 developed a deep learning model called nCOVnet for detecting COVID-19 based on X-rays. A dataset of 284 X-ray images was used of which 142 images are normal cases and 142 images are COVID-19 cases. The model achieved an accuracy of 88.1%.

Nigam et al. 24 used transfer learning to utilize 5 pre-trained models which are DenseNet121, NASNet, Xception, VGG16, and EfficientNet to classify Coronavirus suspected cases as normal, COVID-19 positive cases, and other classes. The used dataset contains 16,634 X-ray images, 6000 normal images, 5634 COVID images, and 5000 imges for others. The achieved accuracies were 79.01%, 85.03%, 88.03%, 89.96%, and 93.48% for VGG16, NASNet, Xception, DenseNet121, and EfficientNet respectively.

Chow et al. 25 used transfer learning to utilize 18 CNN models including VGG-19, VGG-16, ShufeNet, SqueezeNet. etc. to classify the cases as normal or COVID-19. The used dataset contains 700 X-ray images (350 normal cases and 350 COVID-19 cases) from both public and private institutes. The highest 4 models are VGG19, VGG-16, ResNet-101, and SqueezeNet with accuracy ranging from 90.7 to 94.3% and F1-score from 90.8 to 94.3%. The VGG-16 is the highest with an accuracy of 94.3% and F1-score of 94.3%. The majority voting of the 18 models and the highest 4 models achieved an accuracy of 93.0% and 94.0%, respectively.
