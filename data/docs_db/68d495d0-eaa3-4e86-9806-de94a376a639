picture_counter_2 The image shows a grayscale X-ray of human lungs. The lungs are isolated against a black background, highlighting their structure and any potential abnormalities. The texture and shading within the lung areas may indicate variations in tissue density.

picture_counter_3 The image is a chest X-ray showing the thoracic region, including the lungs, heart, and surrounding structures. The ribs and spine are visible, providing a view of the internal chest anatomy.

(D) Complement

picture_counter_4 The image shows a 3D rendering of human lungs. The lungs are displayed side by side, showcasing their anatomical structure. The texture appears to illustrate internal features, possibly highlighting areas of interest for medical analysis.

picture_counter_5 The image is a chest X-ray showing the thoracic cavity, including the lungs, heart, and surrounding structures. The lungs appear as dark areas on either side of the heart, which is centrally located. The ribs and spine are visible as lighter structures, and the diaphragm can be seen at the bottom of the image.

( b) Enhanced HE

picture_counter_6 The image is a chest X-ray showing the thoracic cavity, including the lungs, heart, and surrounding structures. The ribs and spine are faintly visible. The image is likely used for diagnostic purposes in medical research.
